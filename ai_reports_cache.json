    "report_text": "My dear,\n\nThank you for sending your photo. The first thing that comes through is this wonderful sense of calm and intellect \u2013 a really grounded, thoughtful energy that's fantastic to see. It\u2019s the perfect canvas to build a signature style upon.\n\nWhat I immediately notice is the great, open structure of your face. With a round shape, this creates a really kind and approachable quality, which is such an asset. It gives you a youthful warmth that we can frame and highlight with some sharp, intentional choices. It's all about creating beautiful contrast.\n\nLet's start with something you're already wearing: eyewear. This is your most powerful accessory. While your current frames have a nice classic feel, we can explore options that will add more definition.\n\n*   **The Sharp Wayfarer:** Think of this as the quintessential frame for adding structure. The strong, straight browline and angular corners are a direct and powerful contrast to the softer lines of your face. It doesn't fight your features; it complements them by introducing a different geometry. Imagine a classic black or a deep tortoiseshell \u2013 it's timeless, smart, and adds instant definition right where it counts.\n\n*   **The Architectural Square:** For a slightly more modern, bold statement, a clean square or rectangular frame would be incredible. Look for one that's slightly wider than your cheekbones. The crisp, clean lines will beautifully sculpt and add length to your face. A thin metal frame in a brushed gunmetal would look exceptionally chic and sophisticated.\n\nNow, for your hair. The key here is volume on top and keeping the sides clean and tight. This draws the eye upward and instantly elongates your facial silhouette.\n\n*   **A Textured Quiff with a Taper:** This would look amazing on you. We\u2019d keep the sides neatly tapered\u2014not buzzed, but cleanly shaped\u2014to create a slim profile. Then, we\u2019d leave enough length on top to style it up and back, using a matte pomade to create texture and piecey separation. It\u2019s polished but not stiff, adding height that is both flattering and effortlessly cool.\n\n*   **The High and Tight Fade with Volume:** For a sharper, more contemporary look, consider a high fade on the sides that blends seamlessly into a longer top. By keeping the volume concentrated at the front and styling it forward or slightly to the side, you create a strong, linear shape that adds incredible structure and a touch of edge.\n\nFinally, let\u2019s talk color. Your complexion has a lovely warmth to it that will just sing with a rich, earthy palette. Forget basic black and think in terms of these tones:\n\n**Deep Teal, Warm Burgundy, Olive Green, Charcoal, and a rich Camel.**\n\nThese colors have depth and character. A burgundy knit or an olive jacket would look incredible against your skin tone, bringing a sophisticated warmth to your entire look.\n\nI hope this gives you some exciting ideas to play with! These aren't rules, just starting points for exploring and refining your own unique style.\n\nCan't wait to see what you try.\n\nWarmly,\nAlex",
