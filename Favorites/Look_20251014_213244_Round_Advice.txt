--- Personalized Suggestions ---

Optical Frames:
Frames that are wider than they are tall (Rectangle, Square, Geometric). Aim for dark colors or patterns to add definition. A high, clear bridge helps elongate the nose.

Sun & Protective Wear:
Angular styles like Square, Wayfarer, or Cat-Eye to create contrast. Avoid small, round, or rimless styles. Look for thick, prominent temples to add width.
